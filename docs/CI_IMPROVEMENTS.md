# CI/CD Pipeline Improvements

## Problem Addressed
The original GitHub Actions workflow was trying to run both race detection (`-race`) and coverage (`-cover`) flags together, which causes Go toolchain instrumentation conflicts resulting in build failures.

## Solution Implemented

### ðŸ”„ Separated Test Jobs
Split the single test job into **3 specialized jobs**:

1. **Unit Tests** (`test`)
   - Runs on multiple OS (Ubuntu, macOS) 
   - Tests Go versions 1.21 and 1.22
   - Command: `go test -v ./...`

2. **Race Detection** (`race`) 
   - Runs on multiple OS (Ubuntu, macOS)
   - Only runs on Go 1.22 (latest)
   - Command: `go test -race ./...`

3. **Test Coverage** (`coverage`)
   - Runs only on Ubuntu (sufficient for coverage)
   - Uses Go 1.22
   - Command: `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`
   - Uploads to Codecov

### ðŸ§¹ Added Cache Cleaning
- Added `go clean -testcache` to all test jobs
- Ensures fresh test runs and avoids cached false positives

### ðŸ“Š Added CI Summary Job
- **`ci-success`** job aggregates all job results
- Can be used as a single required status check
- Treats security scans as optional (non-blocking)
- Provides clear success/failure reporting

## Benefits

âœ… **Eliminates build failures** from Go toolchain conflicts  
âœ… **Comprehensive testing** - unit tests, race detection, coverage  
âœ… **Parallel execution** - jobs run concurrently for faster CI  
âœ… **Resource optimization** - race detection only on latest Go version  
âœ… **Clear status reporting** - single job for PR status checks  
âœ… **Maintainable** - each job has a single responsibility  

## Jobs Overview

| Job | Purpose | OS | Go Versions | Flags |
|-----|---------|----|-----------|----- |
| `test` | Unit Tests | Ubuntu, macOS | 1.21, 1.22 | `-v` |
| `race` | Race Detection | Ubuntu, macOS | 1.22 | `-race` |
| `coverage` | Test Coverage | Ubuntu | 1.22 | `-cover` |
| `lint` | Code Linting | Ubuntu | 1.22 | golangci-lint |
| `build` | Build Verification | Ubuntu, macOS | 1.22 | N/A |
| `security` | Security Scans | Ubuntu | 1.22 | gosec, nancy |
| `ci-success` | Status Summary | Ubuntu | N/A | N/A |

## Usage
Set `ci-success` as the required status check in GitHub repository settings for a clean, single check that covers all CI requirements.
